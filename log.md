# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a rails app for my podcast website blog. Set up the initial blog functionality by creating articles and comments with basic design.

**Thoughts:** I am still getting the hang of creating rails applications. Even though I have created a blog before this was a good refresher for me to get started. Here on out it will get more difficult as I have to figure out permissions and create a log in process to protect who can and can't add posts or comments.

### Day 2: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added user authentication to my website including the ability for users to create accounts and login as well as authenticate whether a user is signed in.

**Thoughts:** I have never done user authentication before and this was neat! I was glad to have found resources that helped me. Unfortunately, it did not include information about logging out. I have found another resource, but it will take me a bit more time to figure that out. I feel good that I am learning something new already!

### Day 3: October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed login feature so that users can logout. Now users must login to visit any page on the site aside from the login. Also added in bootstrap for some basic styling and added an initial navbar.

**Thoughts:**: I have more work to do on the login/logout features so that people dont' have to login to read the blog, but I'll get there. Doing some HTML and CSS styling will be nice because I feel more comfortable in that space. However, I am excited that I figure dout my signout feature so folks will not be trapped signed in. There will be more that I have to do there moving forward, which might be hard, but I think I'll get there.

### Day 4: November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added roles and admin status functionality.

**Thoughts:**: I am still figuring out how to create the best role setup for users. But now I have roles and admin status for all users. Now I need to figure out how to toggle admin on/off and make it so only admins can see the admin status and do that toggle. This is challenging, but I am finding lots of great resources online to help me create these methods. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to tie it all together eventually :)
