# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: May 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic HTML and Basic HTML5, Basic CSS, and Applied Visual Design courses on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I'm restarting this again and since it's been a while, I need some refreshers. My plan is to finish all of the FreeCodeCamp projects by the end of the summer. It seems like a lot so we'll see how well that goes, but so far Day one has been a success. I'm eager to get to the projects portion!

#### Previous Attempt
### Day 1: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a rails app for my podcast website blog. Set up the initial blog functionality by creating articles and comments with basic design.

**Thoughts:** I am still getting the hang of creating rails applications. Even though I have created a blog before this was a good refresher for me to get started. Here on out it will get more difficult as I have to figure out permissions and create a log in process to protect who can and can't add posts or comments.

### Day 2: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added user authentication to my website including the ability for users to create accounts and login as well as authenticate whether a user is signed in.

**Thoughts:** I have never done user authentication before and this was neat! I was glad to have found resources that helped me. Unfortunately, it did not include information about logging out. I have found another resource, but it will take me a bit more time to figure that out. I feel good that I am learning something new already!

### Day 3: October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed login feature so that users can logout. Now users must login to visit any page on the site aside from the login. Also added in bootstrap for some basic styling and added an initial navbar.

**Thoughts:**: I have more work to do on the login/logout features so that people dont' have to login to read the blog, but I'll get there. Doing some HTML and CSS styling will be nice because I feel more comfortable in that space. However, I am excited that I figure dout my signout feature so folks will not be trapped signed in. There will be more that I have to do there moving forward, which might be hard, but I think I'll get there.

### Day 4: November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added roles and admin status functionality.

**Thoughts:**: I am still figuring out how to create the best role setup for users. But now I have roles and admin status for all users. Now I need to figure out how to toggle admin on/off and make it so only admins can see the admin status and do that toggle. This is challenging, but I am finding lots of great resources online to help me create these methods. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to tie it all together eventually :)

### Day 5: November 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed 63% of Learn Basic Javascript on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:**: I am not in a great mental state cause, you know, the world is falling apart. So today I took it a little easy and gave myself a break from the project while I did some learning of Javascript. I am not as familiar with Javascript so I wanted to do some back to basics training to get better. Already I think I have a decent grasp on it thanks to knowing Ruby and am picking it up pretty easily! I guess it helps that I already knew some of this already too. :)

### Day 6: November 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work in Learn Basic Javascript on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:**: Another rough day (actually election day) so I stuck to some calm lessons on Learn Basic Javascript, but didn't make as much progress. It's a bit much right now with everything going on so just keeping myself calm. :)

### Day 7: November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started [Code Heir Pong Tutorial](https://codeheir.com/2019/02/04/how-to-code-pong-1972-1/)

**Thoughts:**: After a couple days off due to election stress I am just getting back to coding. I felt pretty confident with what I had learned from the basic javascript that I wanted to see it in more action and wanted to do some real coding. So far it's a fun project and I am really enjoying it!
