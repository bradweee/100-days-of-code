# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 29. 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a rails app for my podcast website blog. Set up the initial blog functionality by creating articles and comments with basic design.

**Thoughts:** I am still getting the hang of creating rails applications. Even though I have created a blog before this was a good refresher for me to get started. Here on out it will get more difficult as I have to figure out permissions and create a log in process to protect who can and can't add posts or comments.
