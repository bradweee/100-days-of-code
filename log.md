# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a rails app for my podcast website blog. Set up the initial blog functionality by creating articles and comments with basic design.

**Thoughts:** I am still getting the hang of creating rails applications. Even though I have created a blog before this was a good refresher for me to get started. Here on out it will get more difficult as I have to figure out permissions and create a log in process to protect who can and can't add posts or comments.

### Day 2: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added user authentication to my website including the ability for users to create accounts and login as well as authenticate whether a user is signed in.

**Thoughts:** I have never done user authentication before and this was neat! I was glad to have found resources that helped me. Unfortunately, it did not include information about logging out. I have found another resource, but it will take me a bit more time to figure that out. I feel good that I am learning something new already!
